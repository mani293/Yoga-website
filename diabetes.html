            DIABETES

    <p class="par">
        Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. The hormone
        insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes, your body
        either
        doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it does make.
        Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs.

    <div class="par">There are a few different types of diabetes:-</div>
    <ol class="par">
        <li>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas,
            where
            insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack. About 10 percent of people with diabetes have this
            type.
        </li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin, and sugar builds up in your blood.
            Prediabetes occurs when your blood sugar is higher than normal, but it’s not high enough for a diagnosis of
            type
            2
            diabetes.</li>
        <li>Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar during pregnancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the
            placenta
            cause
            this type of diabetes.</li>
        <br>A rare condition called diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a
        similar name.
        It’s
        a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body.

        Each type of diabetes has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h1 class="hed"> Symptoms of Diabetes :-</h1>
    <h2 class="hed" style="color:darkgreen ;">Type 1:-</h2>

    <ul class="par">Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can include:

        <Li>extreme hunger</Li>
        <Li> increased thirst</Li>
        <Li>unintentional weight loss</Li>
        <Li> frequent urination</Li>
        <Li> blurry vision</Li>
        <Li> tiredness</Li>
        <Li> It may also result in mood changes.</Li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="hed" style="color: darkgreen;">Type 2:-</h2>
    <ul class="par">

        Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can include:

        <li> increased hunger</li>
        <li>increased thirst</li>
        <li>increased urination</li>
        <li>blurry vision</li>
        <li>tiredness</li>
        <li>sores that are slow to heal</li>
        <li>It may also cause recurring infections. This is because elevated glucose levels make it harder for the body
            to heal.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="hed" style="color: darkgreen;"> Gestational diabetes:-</h2>
    <p class="par">
        Most women with gestational diabetes don’t have any symptoms. The condition is often detected during a routine
        blood sugar test or oral glucose tolerance test that is usually performed between the 24th and 28th weeks of
        gestation.

        In rare cases, a woman with gestational diabetes will also experience increased thirst or urination.
    </p>
    <h1 class="hed">Causes of diabetes:-</h1>
    <p class="par">
        Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="hed" style="color: darkgreen;">Type 1 diabetes</h2>
    <p class="par">
        Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks
        and
        destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.

        Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off the immune system attack.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hed" style="color: darkgreen;">Type 2 diabetes</h2>
    <p class="par">Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or obese
        increases your
        risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of
        insulin
        on your blood sugar.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hed" style="color: darkgreen;">Gestational diabetes</h2>
    <p class="par">Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces
        hormones that make a
        pregnant woman’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during
        pregnancy.

        Women who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during their pregnancy are more
        likely
        to get gestational diabetes.

        This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes
        and to
        be overweight.
