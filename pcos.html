                POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME
            </h1>
        </center>
    </div>
    <p>
    <ul class="para"> PCOS is a “syndrome,” or group of symptoms that affects the ovaries and ovulation.<br>
        Its three main
        features are:

        <li>cysts in the ovaries.</li>
        <li> high levels of male hormones.</li>
        <li> irregular or skipped periods.</li>

        In PCOS, many small, fluid-filled sacs grow inside the ovaries. The word “polycystic” means “many cysts.”

        <br> These sacs are actually follicles, each one containing an immature egg. The eggs never mature enough to
        trigger
        ovulation.

        <br>The lack of ovulation alters levels of estrogen, progesterone, FSH, and LH. Estrogen and progesterone
        levels
        are
        lower than usual, while androgen levels are higher than usual.

        <br>Extra male hormones disrupt the menstrual cycle, so women with PCOS get fewer periods than usual.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h1 class="hd">What causes it?</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Doctors don’t know exactly what causes PCOS. They believe that high levels of male hormones prevent the
        ovaries
        from
        producing hormones and making eggs normally.

        Genes, insulin resistance, and inflammation have all been linked to excess androgen production.

        <h1 id="box"> Common symptoms of PCOS:-</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="para">
        Some women start seeing symptoms around the time of their first period. Others only discover they have PCOS
        after they’ve gained a lot of weight or they’ve had trouble getting pregnant.

        The most common PCOS symptoms are:
    <ul class="para">
        <li>Irregular periods. A lack of ovulation prevents the uterine lining from shedding every month. Some women
            with
            PCOS get fewer than eight periods a year.</li>
        <li> Heavy bleeding. The uterine lining builds up for a longer period of time, so the periods you do get can be
            heavier than normal.</li>
        <li> Hair growth. More than 70 percent of women with this condition grow hair on their face and body — including
            on
            their back, belly, and chest .</li>
        Excess hair growth is called hirsutism.

        <li> Acne. Male hormones can make the skin oilier than usual and cause breakouts on areas like the face, chest,
            and
            upper back.</li>
        <li>Weight gain. Up to 80 percent of women with PCOS are overweight or obese .
        </li>
        <li> Male-pattern baldness. Hair on the scalp gets thinner and fall out.
        </li>
        <li> Darkening of the skin. Dark patches of skin can form in body creases like those on the neck, in the groin,
            and
            under the breasts.</li>
        <li>Headaches. Hormone changes can trigger headaches in some women.</li>
    </ul>
