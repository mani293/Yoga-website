            <h3 class="heading"> It helps you live in the present.</h3>

            <p>Most of us spend the majority of our time thinking about the past or the future (regretting, worrying,
                planning), or checking out completely into the land of cell phones and social media. Many of the
                benefits of
                yoga stem from the ability to unplug and focus on what’s going on in your body and in your life right
                now.
                Happiness can only be found here and now.</p>

            <h3 class="heading">It helps with stress relief.</h3>

            <p>Yoga reduces perceived stress and anxiety, which in turn reduces the physical effects of stress on the
                body.
                By encouraging relaxation, yoga helps to lower the levels of the stress hormones such as cortisol.

                benefits include lowering blood pressure and heart rate, improving digestion and boosting the immune
                system.

            <h3 class="heading">you will sleep better.</h3>
            <p>When we are less stressed we sleep better, and when we sleep better we are less stressed. Physical
                activity
                and mental relaxation fuel this virtuous cycle. A variety of studies have shown that yoga can improve
                sleep
                quality and quantity in people struggling with insomnia. Other studies have shown similar results in
                other
                groups of people, including cancer survivors and postmenopausal women.

            <p>
                Mindfulness is a buzz word at the moment and – with all the apps, downloads, classes and CDs – has
                become a billion dollar business. [1] Mindfulness, however, doesn’t have to mean meditating for long
                periods of time, and it doesn’t have to be something profound that’s difficult to keep up. Being mindful
                just means paying a little more attention to each action you do, allowing you to be more present, aware
                and alive in each moment. Better to be mindful than mind-full…

            <p>
                Having a little time for yourself is extremely important – particularly for those who spend their lives
                caring for others. Giving to others is a vital aspect of life, and helps us feel more connected to the
                world around us. However, in order to give, we have to be full first. As Gandhi (and Jimi Hendrix) said
                “If you want to change the world, change yourself first”.

            <p>
                The skin is one of the first places in the body to display signs of stress and nutrient deficiency. By
                practicing a combination of some of the more calming aspects of yoga, such as Pranayama and meditation,
                as well as an active yoga practice, the body and all its systems receive better circulation, and the
                reduced stress levels can even help reduce conditions like acne and eczema.

            <p>
                While it’s controversial as to whether twisting yoga asanas actually ‘detox’ the body, it’s fair to say
                that a yoga practice definitely helps to clear toxins from the body. Getting things moving inside and
                outside helps shift any lurking toxins and rids the body of them quicker. Being aware and mindful of
                your thoughts too, can help to ‘detox’ the mind of any ‘toxic’ thoughts….
