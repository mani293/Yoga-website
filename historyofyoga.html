            The beginnings of Yoga were developed by the Indus-Sarasvati civilization in Northern India over 5,000 years
            ago. The word yoga was first mentioned in the oldest sacred texts, the Rig Veda. The Vedas were a collection
            of
            texts containing songs, mantras and rituals to be used by Brahmans, the Vedic priests. Yoga was slowly
            refined
            and developed by the Brahmans and Rishis (mystic seers) who documented their practices and beliefs in the
            upanishads, a huge work containing over 200 scriptures. The most renowned of the Yogic scriptures is the
            Bhagavad-Gîtâ, composed around 500 B.C.E. The Upanishads took the idea of ritual sacrifice from the Vedas
            and
            internalized it, teaching the sacrifice of the ego through self-knowledge, action (karma yoga) and wisdom
            (jnana
            yoga).

            In the pre-classical stage, yoga was a mishmash of various ideas, beliefs and techniques that often
            conflicted and contradicted each other. The Classical period is defined by Patanjali’s Yoga-Sûtras, the
            first systematic presentation of yoga. Written some time in the second century, this text describes the path
            of RAJA YOGA, often called "classical yoga". Patanjali organized the practice of yoga into an "eight limbed
            path" containing the steps and stages towards obtaining Samadhi or enlightenment. Patanjali is often
            considered the father of yoga and his Yoga-Sûtras still strongly influence most styles of modern yoga.

            A few centuries after Patanjali, yoga masters created a system of practices designed to rejuvenate the body
            and prolong life. They rejected the teachings of the ancient Vedas and embraced the physical body as the
            means to achieve enlightenment. They developed Tantra Yoga, with radical techniques to cleanse the body and
            mind to break the knots that bind us to our physical existence. This exploration of these physical-spiritual
            connections and body centered practices led to the creation of what we primarily think of yoga in the West:
            Hatha Yoga.

            In the late 1800s and early 1900s, yoga masters began to travel to the West, attracting attention and
            followers. This began at the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, when Swami Vivekananda wowed the
            attendees with his lectures on yoga and the universality of the world’s religions. In the 1920s and 30s,
            Hatha Yoga was strongly promoted in India with the work of T. Krishnamacharya, Swami Sivananda and other
            yogis practicing Hatha Yoga. Krishnamacharya opened the first Hatha Yoga school in Mysore in 1924 and in
            1936 Sivananda founded the Divine Life Society on the banks of the holy Ganges River. Krishnamacharya
            produced three students that would continue his legacy and increase the popularity of Hatha Yoga: B.K.S.
            Iyengar, T.K.V. Desikachar and Pattabhi Jois. Sivananda was a prolific author, writing over 200 books on
            yoga, and established nine ashrams and numerous yoga centers located around the world.

            The importation of yoga to the West still continued at a trickle until Indra Devi opened her yoga studio in
            Hollywood in 1947. Since then, many more western and Indian teachers have become pioneers, popularizing
            hatha yoga and gaining millions of followers. Hatha Yoga now has many different schools or styles, all
            emphasizing the many different aspects of the practice.
